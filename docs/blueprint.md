## Core Features:

- Main Navigation: Left navigation menu with options for 'My Recipes', 'AI Generated Recipes', and 'Equipment'.
- Recipe List Display: Display a list of user-created recipes in a rectangular container with 'Create a Recipe' and 'Filter' buttons. The 'Create a Recipe' button should trigger the recipe creation form.

- Recipe Saving: A 'Save' button at the bottom of the recipe form to store the created recipe and display it in 'My Recipes'.
